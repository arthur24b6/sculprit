* Sculprit

Sculprit is a javascript powered static site generator. Sculprit is a thought experiment- can the duties of content rendering be handed to the client rather than compiling server side?

Sculprit renders markdown content on client side with Twig templates.

To install: clone this repository into the root of a server. You will need to make sure that Apache allows for .htaccess files to do url rewriting and directory listing. You can add new content to /content.
