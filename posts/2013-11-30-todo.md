Whether or not any of this should be done is an entirely different question. Or should have been thought of in the first place.

* Make post sorting not rely on Apache.
* Allow different template selections from posts.
* Improve URL handling
* Figure out a better way to handle post naming
* Cleanup the handling of metadata at the top of posts
* Consider how to do content tags with local storage
* Consider pagination.
