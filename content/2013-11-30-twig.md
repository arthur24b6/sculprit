description: A description of the templating system that Sculprit implements.

---

Sculprit uses [Twig.js](https://github.com/justjohn/twig.js/wiki) as its templating engine.

Sculprit allows individual posts to identify the templates that should be used to display their content. New templates can be dropped into the **/templates** directory and will be accessible to posts.

The demo will feature the most recent post on the front page and list all of the content in the sidebar. The sidebar is only present on the front page.
