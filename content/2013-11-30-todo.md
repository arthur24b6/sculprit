description: A list of items that could be considered to extend this madness.

If one were to take this project one step closer to being something like a CMS, it might be worth thinking about doing some of the following:

* Cache the posts array locally to allow for things like dynamic tags, pagination, and performance considerations.
* Improve URL handling- perhaps a url: attribute in posts?
* Navigation systems.
* Codebase size.
* etc.

Whether or not any of this should be done is an entirely different question. Or should have been thought of in the first place.
