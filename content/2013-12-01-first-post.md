Sculprit is a thought experiment.

Sculprit is also a javascript powered templated content system which dynamically serves markdown formatted content.

Sculprit uses:

* [Pagedown](http://code.google.com/p/pagedown/)
* [davis.js](http://davisjs.com)
* [Twig.js](https://github.com/justjohn/twig.js/wiki)
* [YAML.js](https://code.google.com/p/javascript-yaml-parser/)

Sculprit is (in theory) similar to static site generators like [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It takes static content that you write in [markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and displays them on the web.

Unlike other Sculpin or Jekyll, Sculprit relies completely on the client's browser to build the site.
